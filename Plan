Project Idea: Predictive Modeling of Survey Respondent Behavior

Goal:
Use past survey data to build a simple model that predicts something useful — like who’s likely to buy a product or how satisfied someone is.

Step 1:
Pick a survey dataset. Choose one thing to predict.

Step 2:
Clean and explore the data. Visualize patterns. Split into train/test sets.

Step 3:
Build and train a model (e.g., logistic regression).

Step 4:
Look at results and key features. Write a short summary.
